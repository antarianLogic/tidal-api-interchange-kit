## Development Guidelines

### General

- Confirm all added API meant to be externally visible is marked `public`
- Test with an external project to verify all added API is visible, builds, and works
 
### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Use Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `#expect`, etc.)
- Use the `Mocker` testing framework if necessary

### Code Style

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Ensure all public types and methods are documented
- Try to follow existing formatting style

### Documentation

- Update inline documentation (DocC comments)
- Update Xcode Documentation Catalog if appropriate
- Add code examples for new features
